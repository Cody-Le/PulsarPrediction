The aim for the research was to classify Pulsar Star Candidate using a logistic regression model. The dataset used in the research was the [HTRU2 Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2).

## Requirements

To install requirements:


The 3 libraries the model use is pandas, matplotlib and numpy. You can decide to install as a package by installing conda or to install them using pip as follow:

```setup
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```



## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
